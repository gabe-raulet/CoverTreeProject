1. implement distributed itree with one layer of replication

2. reintegrate distributed cover tree (data parallel version) into this repo using
   the new PointIndexer setup and distributed itree.

3. implement distributed cover tree (task parallel version) incorporating load balancing
   strategies based on different functors (as seen in ElegantTree repo).

4. implement distributed cover tree with lazy construction of non-replicated sub-trees
   based upon an input threshold which can be used to build so-called "ghost sub-trees"
   on each local processor.
